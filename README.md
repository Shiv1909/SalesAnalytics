# Sales_Analytics

Welcome to the repository for my data analysis project focused on monthly sales for an e-commerce business. In this project, I dive into a dataset capturing sales transactions and perform a series of data processing, cleaning, augmentation, and exploration steps to gain meaningful insights.

To facilitate analysis, I merged data from each month into a single CSV file for a consolidated view. Cleaning is a dynamic process, often driven by encountering errors during operations. I've tackled data inconsistencies and missing values as they surfaced.I've enriched the dataset by adding columns for the month of each transaction and the corresponding city.

Feel free to adapt and build upon this project for your own analyses. Whether you're new to data analysis or looking to expand your skills, this project offers a practical exploration of data manipulation and insights extraction.
